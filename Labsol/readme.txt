Note: 
====

In some exercises, I provided several versions of coding solutions to solve the same problem so as to enrich your understanding.

I used preprocessor directives #define, #if, #elif, #endif to control which version of solution is used for compilation.

You can change the first line from 

   #define VERSION 1

to

   #define VERSION 2

in order to compile the second version of code. Other versions would have been disabled and won't be seen from the compiler.
